##  How It Works

1. **Prepopulated Guests** are displayed when the page loads.
2. Users can **fill out the form** to check in new guests.
3. On submission, JavaScript:
   - Validates input
   - Checks if the room is available
   - Adds the guest if valid
   - Updates the guest list dynamically
   - Displays a message if the room is already booked
4. The form is cleared after each successful check-in.
